# Simple Signup Page README

Welcome to the Simple Signup Page! This README provides a brief overview of the Signup Page, its features, and instructions for usage.

## Overview

The Simple Signup Page is a basic web page created using HTML and CSS only. It serves as a template for collecting user information for registration purposes. This minimalistic page is ideal for simple projects that do not require complex backend logic.

## Features

- **User-friendly Form**: The page includes a user-friendly registration form with fields for username, email, and password.

- **Basic Styling**: CSS is used to style the page and make it visually appealing.

- **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks good on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

- **No Backend Logic**: This is a static page, so it doesn't handle form submissions or data storage. You'll need to implement backend logic separately if you want to process form submissions.
